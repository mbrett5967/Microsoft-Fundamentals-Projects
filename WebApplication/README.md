# Getting started with web development using Visual Studio Code


### Summary

> Here I Practice the beginning steps of web development by creating a simple web project in Visual Studio Code that contains a web page, a CSS file, and a JavaScript file. I Learn how to use developer tools in my browser to check my work.

**Learning objectives**

In this module, I practice how to:

- Create a basic web page using HTML.
- Apply styles to page elements using CSS.
- Create themes using CSS.
- Add support for switching between themes using JavaScript.
- Inspect the website using browser developer tools.

## Layout Guide

The layout for the program files will be as follows:

- HTML file:
  >for content
- CSS file:
  >for styling
- JavaScript file:
  >for interactivity


## First Stage

> The first step was to setup the three files needed for the application within VS code, ( HTML, CSS, .JS). I then edited the HTML file input body, and added a headline, list elements and underline using the description provided by Microsoft. I also linked it with the CSS file.
> Afterwhich, I previewed the setup, by opening it in my default browser ( Safari)

## Second Stage

> The next stage involved opening up the developer tool interface in-browser, exploring how the code and browser communicate and translate with each other. I then moved to the next scenario which was to use the CSS file to add a theme and apply CSS styles to HTML page elements and add some CSS code to define a light and dark theme. Then, I checked the results in the browser's developer tools.

## Third Stage

> Next up , was to add a dark theme, setting the grounding for the feature implementation. The goal would be to eventually allow theme switching within the application.
